                <p class="card-text">
                    I pursued my education in Economics and Finance at the prestigious University of Cape Town. During my time there, I gained valuable knowledge in financial markets, economic theories, and business strategies. The program exposed me to a diverse range of subjects, equipping me with a well-rounded understanding of the financial world.
                    <br><br>
                    Eager to expand my expertise in the technology industry, I enrolled in a Software Engineering bootcamp with Hyperion Dev. Throughout the bootcamp, I honed my programming skills and gained practical experience in developing applications and working with cutting-edge technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    My education journey has not only shaped my academic foundation but has also instilled in me the importance of continuous learning and adaptability, which I carry with me as I explore new opportunities in my career.
